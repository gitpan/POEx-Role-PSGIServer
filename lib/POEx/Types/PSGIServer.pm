=head1 NAME

POEx::Types::PSGIServer - Provides type constraints for use in POEx::Role::PSGIServer

=head1 VERSION

version 1.102530

=head1 TYPES

=head2 PSGIServerContext

PSGIServerContext is defined as a Hash with the following keys:

    request => HTTPRequest,
    wheel => Optional[Wheel],
    version => Str,
    protocol => Str, 
    connection => Str,
    keep_alive => Bool,
    chunked => Optional[Bool],
    explicit_length => Optional[Bool],

The context is passed around to identify the current connection and what it is expecting

=head2 HTTPRequest

This is a simple class_type for HTTP::Request

=head2 HTTPCode

This constraint uses HTTP::Status to check if the Int is a valid HTTP::Status code

=head2 PSGIBody

The PSGIBody constraint covers two of the three types of body responses valid for PGSI responses: a real filehandle or a blessed reference that duck-types getline and close

=head2 PSGIResponse

This constraint checks responses from PSGI applications for a valid HTTPCode, an ArrayRef of headers, and the Optional PSGIBody or ArrayRef body
