=head1 NAME

POEx::Role::PSGIServer::Streamer - Provides streaming filehandle PSGI implementation

=head1 VERSION

version 1.103340

=head1 PUBLIC_ATTRIBUTES

=head2 server_context

    is: ro, isa: PSGIServerContext, required: 1

This is the server context from POEx::Role::PSGIServer. It is needed to determine the semantics of the current request

=head1 PRIVATE_ATTRIBUTES

=head2 closed_chunk

    is: rw, isa: Bool, default: 0

closed_chunk is a flag used by the advised L</around done_writing> to know whether the chunked transfer encoding needs a terminator or if the terminator has already been written to the output buffer

=head1 PROTECTED_METHODS

=head2 around done_writing

done_writing is advised to check if the context demands a chunked terminator and if one hasn't been sent yet. If so, it marks L</closed_chunk>, puts the terminator into the output buffer, and returns. Upon second invocation when the buffers are flushed, it will execute the original method.

=head1 PRIVATE_METHODS

=head2 _build_filter

_build_filter is overridden to return a L<POE::Filter::Map> filter if the current response is to be chunk transfer encoded.
